    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>
      We plan to expose the links and connections between news sources and to examine how user’s become separated into “Echo Chambers” via the Facebook “Filter Bubble” effect. Furthermore, we plan to utilize this to see how individual profiles compare with aggregate usage and trust trends. There are two identified end users of our visualization. Firstly, users of social media, specifically Facebook, will use this tool to examine their actual news spheres and how that compares to their demographic profile. Secondly, News Sources shall be able to utilize this tool to identify which news spheres demographic profiles (input) most likely will fall. 

The aim for this project is to allow users to visually see what sites and “Bubbles” of ideologically similar sites their news is coming from. More so, users will be able to see what sources of news they are being excluded from, and how these sources relate to one another. If any user isn’t curious about their own sources of news, they will still be able to utilize our visualization to see the different “groups” of news sources, and how they relate to one another.

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
      We plan to use existing DataSets concerning the relation between different News  Sites through the GDELT project. (http://gdeltproject.org/#downloading). We are also looking into utilizing the Facebook API to extract and analyze data on a User's exposure to News Sources.
