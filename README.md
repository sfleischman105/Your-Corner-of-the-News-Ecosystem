## Project

In todayâ€™s divisive political climate, Americans are becoming increasingly aware of their consumption of political news. Serious questions have been raised about how we share, read, and propagate news. While user behavior can be studied and surveyed, understanding how political websites relate and link to one another is a fundamental step to understanding user consumption of news. For example, a user who frequents the site reuters.com might also frequent the site politco.com, in hopes of diversifying their consumption of news. Unfortunately for the user, there is no direct way to see how similar the two sites are.

Our group felt that many of the discussions concerning user engagement with political news sites centered around the bubble created by social media. Rather than looking at how users interacted with websites, we set out to explore something deeper: the connections between these political news sites. Analyzing how news sites relate to each other hits two birds with one stone, as it shows where news sites get their news, alongside implicating the diversity of news viewers receive when visiting multiple sites. Our Project aims to visualize and allow user exploration of these hidden connections between news sites.
